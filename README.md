## Machine Learning in a Kaggle dataset :bar_chart:

This is my first Python project and it is about applying machine learning models in a Water dataset from Kaggle.
I got 70% accuracy in my prediction models, which i think is good for this usage, once you can classify the non-potable water by those features with a precision of 78%.
